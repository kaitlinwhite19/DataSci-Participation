This Folder encompasses the work done on the class's 2nd meeting, on 1-23-2020. 
The main focus of this lecture was learning the tools we'd be using for the class, like github and rmarkdown.
The file contents are as follows
1) s02_rmd_exploration.rmd: the markdown script for the assignment
2) s02_rmd_exploration.html: the .rmd script's output html file
3) s02_rmd_exploration.md: the .rmd script's output md file
