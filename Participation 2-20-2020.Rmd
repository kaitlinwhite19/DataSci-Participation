## Setting Up

### Error Allowance

<!---The following chunk allows errors when knitting--->
```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

### Reminders
**When you make an Rmd file for participation or homework, be sure to do this**:

1. Change the file output to both html and md _documents_ (not notebook).
  - See the `keep_md: TRUE` argument above.

2. `knit` the document. 

3. Stage and commit the Rmd and knitted documents.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
