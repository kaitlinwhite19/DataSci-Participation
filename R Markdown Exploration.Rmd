This is a document. Words words words. Yay. Words.


This is a code block - __r__ is the reference to what programming language is in use. The lower commands are a section of R code. I'm using this chunk to install packages.

```{r} 
# install.packages("rmarkdown")
# install.packages
# 
# install.packages('gapminder')
# install.packages('DT')
# install.packages('tibble')
```


Now ill use the library function to get ready to use them.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(DT)
library(tibble)
```


```{r}

gapminder

````

heres where i got lost. 
```{r}
mtcars

#mean(mtcars[mpg])



```
 
 
 Using tibble - not sure what this did?
```{r}

tibble::as_tibble(mtcars)

```

took a few minutes to edit the YAML
